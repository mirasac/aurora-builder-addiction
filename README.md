# aurora-builder-addiction
Custom content for Aurora Builder.

## Purpose
Aurora Builder is a promising free tool for the creation of characters for D&D 5e, curated and developed by [Bas Driessen](https://github.com/swdriessen). This is a personal repository created to experiment with this tool and to add content of any kind for the integration in characters used in actual, previous and future games. Every information about the project can be retrieved on the [official site](https://aurorabuilder.com/).

## Fun facts
The name of this repository is not a misspelling but an attempt of a pun using the words "addiction" and "addition".
