# aurora-builder-addiction
Custom content for Aurora Builder.

## Purpose
Aurora Builder is a promising free tool for the creation of characters for D&D 5e, curated and developed by [Bas Driessen](https://github.com/swdriessen). This is a personal repository created to experiment with this tool and to add content of any kind for the integration in characters used in actual, previous and future games. Every information about the project can be retrieved on the [official site](https://aurorabuilder.com/).

## References
On the official site there is a section with some [(very few) informations](https://aurorabuilder.com/documentation/) on the editing and creation of content. Much more useful sources are the [GitHub repositories](http://aurorabuilder.com/content/#repository) listed on the official site, whether for checking issues or for learning from exisiting material.

## Fun facts
The name of this repository is not a misspelling but an attempt of making a pun using the words "addiction" and "addition".
